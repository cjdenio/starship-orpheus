You can't help but notice that the UI looks terrible! So terrible, in fact, that you can barely figure out how to log in.

_Needs more eeby deeby_, you think.

Being the developer you are, you decide to take a minute to spice up the communications UI while the rest of your team isn't looking :shushing_face:

*Your objective:* in a single HTML file, create a page that simply contains the text \`EEBY DEEBY\`, with this style:

- a \`sans-serif\` font
- the thickest possible font weight
- red (\`#FF0000\`)
- 30px font size

There's a catch though: the text must be *vertically and horizontally centered*. _Is this even possible?_ you think to yourself.

You may submit your new UI in one of 2 different ways:

- Upload an \`.html\` file to this channel
- Place your solution in a text snippet (not a message) sent to this channel. (make sure the \`type\` is set to HTML)

Good luck!`);

};

export default centering;
