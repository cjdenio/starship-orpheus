    `_You wake up._
      
Looking around, you recall that it's 2036, and you're a crew member on the Starship _Orpheus_, a vessel transporting some of the brightest engineering minds to a base on Mars.

Unfortunately, your ship was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine failure, with your base nowhere in sight.

You and your fellow crew members quickly discover that the _Orpheus_' communications and navigational systems are down, and there's no telling how long your oxygen will last.`
