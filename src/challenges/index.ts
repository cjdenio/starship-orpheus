    `_You wake up._
      
Looking around, you recall that it's 2036, and you're a crew member on the Starship _Orpheus_, a vessel transporting some of the brightest engineering minds to a base on Mars.

Unfortunately, your ship was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine failure, with your base nowhere in sight.

You and your fellow crew members quickly discover that the _Orpheus_' communications and navigational systems are down, and there's no telling how long your oxygen will last.`

A hush falls over your group.

    `A relieved commotion can be heard over the radio. Joyful shouts of "They're alive!" and "Gadzooks!" ring through your ears, and you can't help but feel a bit of relief yourself.

The apparent leader grabs the microphone again, and, though out of breath, she begins to speak.

> "Your starship has an inbuilt space rover, tucked away in a secret room, designed for situations just like this one."

She describes the exact location of the rover, and you quickly jot down notes on that sticky note you found earlier.

> "To open the room, two of your crew members must insert their keys into seperate control pods found on opposite ends of the starship, and turn them simultaneously."

More commotion. You think you hear "_Pizza's here!_", but you can't quite be sure.

> "Woohoo!!!... erm... if you'll excuse me, our lunch has just arrived. Best of luck to you all."

Appreciating the rarity of space pizza, you quickly thank her and log off.`

_sigh._ The fuel gauge tells you all you need to know.

Frustratedly scanning the room, your eyes land on a medieval-looking fuel can in the corner. The instructions read:

> :fuelpump: "Your Wofford Industries Mark II Space-Grade Land Rover is equipped with a state-of-the-art suspension and boasts a..."

Hang on.

Here we go: :point_down:

_That doesn't sound good._`
